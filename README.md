# Cryptocurrencies

For this challenge assignment, a prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is a little lost in the world of cryptocurrencies. They have used us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. 

The data we have to work with is not ideal so we had to process it to fit the machine learning model. Unsupervised learning was used since there was no known output. Then a clustering algorithm was used to group the cryptocurrencies. Visualizations were created to share the findings.
